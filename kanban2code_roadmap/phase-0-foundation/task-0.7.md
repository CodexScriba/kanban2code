# Initialize Project and Build Tooling (Superseded)

## Goal
Avoid duplicate tracking of the project bootstrap work. Use `phase-0-foundation/task-0.0.md` as the single source of truth.

## Scope
- Do not execute separately; reference and update `task-0.0` instead.
- If new bootstrap requirements emerge, add them to `task-0.0` rather than reviving this card.

## Notes
Kept only as a pointer to prevent parallel/duplicate workstreams.
