# Initialize Project and Build Tooling (Superseded)

## Goal
Avoid duplicate tracking of the project bootstrap work. Use `phase-0-foundation/task-0.0.md` as the single source of truth.

## Scope
- Do not execute separately; reference and update `task-0.0` instead.
- If new bootstrap requirements emerge, add them to `task-0.0` rather than reviving this card.

## Notes
Kept only as a pointer to prevent parallel/duplicate workstreams.

## Audit Instructions
After completing this task, please update the [Phase 0 Audit](../phase#_audit.md) with:
1. **Files Created**: List all files created in this task with their purpose
2. **Files Modified**: List any existing files that were modified and why
3. **Files Analyzed**: List any files that were examined for reference
4. **Key Changes**: Briefly describe the main changes made to support this task

Note: This task is superseded by task-0.0, so no implementation work is expected.
