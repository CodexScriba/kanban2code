# Polish How-It-Works and Project Documentation

## Goal
Make it easy for both you and AI agents to understand the Kanban2Code system.

## Scope
- Refine `how-it-works.md`:
  - Emphasize Inbox-first philosophy.
  - Describe stage semantics.
  - Explain tags-as-type convention (`bug`, `idea`, `roadmap`, etc.).
- Update `architecture.md` to reflect actual extension architecture.
- Update `project-details.md` with:
  - Clear problem statement.
  - Users (solo devs with multi-agent workflows).
  - Success criteria.

## Notes
These docs become core context for AI agents and future you.
