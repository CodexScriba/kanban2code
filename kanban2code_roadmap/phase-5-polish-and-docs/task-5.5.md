# Validate MVP Feature Checklist and Define Post-v1 Backlog

## Goal
Confirm that v1.0 matches the approved spec and identify post-MVP work.

## Scope
- Cross-check implemented features against the MVP list:
  - Filesystem, stages, archive, context system, sidebar, board, copy-with-context, etc.
- Mark anything missing or partial as new tasks tagged `post-v1`.
- Create a separate roadmap or project for:
  - Project templates.
  - Agent presets.
  - Batch operations.
  - Task dependencies.
  - Time tracking.
  - Exports.
  - Migration tools for other task management systems.
- Optionally create a `projects/kanban2code-post-v1/` project to hold these.

## Notes
This keeps v1 focused while giving you a place to park future ideas.
