# Dogfood Kanban2Code on the Kanban2Code Project

## Goal
Use Kanban2Code to manage its own development and validate the workflow.

## Scope
- Create `projects/kanban2code/_context.md` with:
  - Project goals, scope, success criteria.
- Use the tasks defined in this roadmap as real tasks:
  - Set stages, tags, and agents as you work.
- Use copy-with-context with your preferred models for:
  - Planning, coding, and auditing.
- Capture friction, missing features, and confusing flows as new tasks.

## Notes
This is where the real UX issues surface; treat them as first-class work.
