# Kanban2Code (Dogfooding)

## Goals
- Use the extension against its own roadmap to validate ergonomics.
- Keep all tasks in `.kanban2code/` style folders so commands and filters stay honest.
- Capture friction (missing commands, clunky flows) as follow-up tasks tagged `bug` or `idea`.

## Scope
- Phase 5 polish/tasks in `kanban2code_roadmap/phase-5-polish-and-docs`.
- Core workflows: task creation, stage moves, copy-with-context, archive.
- Tag taxonomy adoption across the board (scope/type/domain/priority).

## Success Criteria
- I can create, move, copy context, and archive tasks without touching the mouse.
- Keyboard shortcuts stay reliable across sidebar/board/editor.
- Logging makes failures debuggable without rerunning commands.
- Tag filters make it trivial to pull “MVP bugs in UI” or “post-v1 roadmap ideas.”

## Current Focus
- Finish Phase 5 polish tasks and stabilize keyboard + tagging UX.
- Build out e2e scaffolding to exercise sidebar + board flows in VS Code.
