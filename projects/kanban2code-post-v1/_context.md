# Kanban2Code Post-v1 Backlog

Use this project to park ideas that shouldn’t block v1.0. Keep tags aligned to the taxonomy so filters keep working (`post-v1`, `roadmap`, `idea`, domain tags).

## Themes to Explore
- Templates: project/phase templates and richer task templates.
- Agent presets: per-model guidance, copy-with-context variants.
- Batch operations: multi-select moves, bulk archive, bulk tag edits.
- Dependencies: blocked-by relationships and visual hints.
- Time tracking: lightweight timers and “time spent” metadata.
- Exports/imports: bridges to other task systems.
- Migration tools: helpers to import existing markdown TODO lists.
