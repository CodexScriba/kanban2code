# Post-v1 Roadmap Notes

- project-templates: scaffold common layouts for new repos (contexts, templates, agents).
- agent-presets: opinionated prompt bundles per model/provider with safe defaults.
- batch-operations: multi-select in sidebar/board for move/archive/tag edits.
- dependencies: blocked-by links and visual indicators on cards.
- time-tracking: optional timers, elapsed/remaining metadata, and reporting hooks.
- exports: markdown/CSV export and import from other task tools.
- migrations: helpers to convert existing TODO.md or Kanban exports into `.kanban2code/`.
